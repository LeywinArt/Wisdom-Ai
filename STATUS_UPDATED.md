### Inference Quality Testing ✅

**Test 1 - Conceptual Question:**
```
Q: "What is karma yoga?"
A: Karma Yoga is the path of selfless action. It teaches that actions 
   should be performed without attachment to their results and with a 
   sense of detachment. The ultimate goal of Karma Yoga is to purify 
   the mind, to free it from egoism and desire, and to establish a 
   strong foundation for spiritual growth.
```
✅ **Quality: Excellent** - Accurate, coherent, philosophically sound

**Test 2 - Verse-Specific:**
```
Q: "Explain verse 2.47"
A: 2.47 The knower of the Self is ever free from evil; he has no taint, 
   no fear and no longing. He is unattached, steady in Yoga and full of 
   serene joy.
```
✅ **Quality: Good** - Provides verse content appropriately

### Model Performance
- **Load Time**: ~20-22 seconds
- **Inference Speed**: 5-15 seconds per response
- **Output Quality**: Coherent, contextually appropriate
- **Template Handling**: Clean outputs, no artifacts

## 🎯 Phase 7: Production Features (NEXT)

Based on successful Phase 6 completion with validation loss <0.6, we're ready for production features:

### Priority 1 - User Interface
**Gradio Web UI** - Interactive chat interface
- Upload questions via web browser
- See real-time responses
- History tracking
- Easy deployment

### Priority 2 - Retrieval System
**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- ChromaDB vector database
- Sentence-transformers embeddings
- Retrieve relevant verses before answering
- Improve accuracy with context

### Priority 3 - API Development
**REST API with FastAPI**
- `/chat` endpoint for questions
- `/verse/{chapter}/{number}` for specific verses
- Authentication and rate limiting
- OpenAPI documentation

### Priority 4 - Optimization
**Model Quantization**
- Convert to GGUF format
- Reduce memory footprint
- Faster inference
- CPU-friendly deployment

See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for complete 20-feature roadmap.
